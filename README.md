## Automate social network with your browser!

> Yes, we moved [Instabot](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot) to the browser. No coding skills needed! Just our [extension](https://get.gramup.me).

This browser extension can help you to:

* Double your followers
* Start Earning with your

There are a lot of ways to automate your activity in social networks but you have to give them your credentials to allow them perform in-app activity for you. As a result you can eventually found yourself being subscribed to unknown people or even lose your account.

We found a hack that allowed to insert all automation scripts into a browser. As a result, we donâ€™t need a backend and your private data - your passwords never left your browser. And we made this tool completely free and open source. Miracle? Reality!

## Tasks

Task is a collection of the requests, for example, a series of likes sent to user media. There are few types of tasks, some are listed above in the "Features" section: like by hashtag, like user's media, follow followers etc. Tasks are added to the queue.

  **When one task is added to the queue, you can't run any new tasks.**

This is intentional: we automatically make big pauses between all the requests so that we don't flood the API. If you want to run a new task, stop current, wait until it unwinds, and then continue.

During the work, task prints all the relevant information to the log. If one of the requests fail, task will continue to progress, and you can see an error and it's description in the log.

**If you were downloading something, the previous and the following results should be saved OK**

If some error happens and all the requests fail, you can stop the task manually. You'll need to wait until it will unwind to it's end, though. However, don't worry, **the data you've already downloaded should be safe and sound.**

If you feel the need for some custom task, you can drop us a feature request into [Issues](https://github.com/instagrambot/gramup/issues/new), [Telegram](https://t.me/instabotproject) or contribute here: [build custom task (Javascript)](https://github.com/instagrambot/gramup/blob/master/client/src/scripts.js).

While we are in early alpha version (again, sorry), please keep our Extension updated. Your browser should update it automatically. You can update it manually:
